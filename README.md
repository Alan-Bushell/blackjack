## Flow

<a name="plan"></a>
### Pre-project Planning

> For project 3 I decided I wanted to make a blackjack style python game in the command line. 

Once I decided on this concept I started to work out my flow and used Lucid Chart to create an easy to follow process. I wanted to create this early on so I can understand the logic needed to complete the project and in what order I should approach it from. 

> Please see the below flow chart to better understand the initial design and concept

# Features Left to implement
> Add a high score tracker for the user
> Add a highscores modal for each seperate game
> Be able to input username to push to a leaderboard

### Additional ideas

> Ideally I would like to add more complex quizzes and offer a range of topics related to the overarching theme.
> One prospective idea was to find popular tourist locations on googlestreet view and allow the user brief moments to slightly pan and decide where they are.
> Ability to allow a user to complete a specific quiz and share the same version of the quiz with a friend as a form of head 2 head competition.
