## Flow

<a name="plan"></a>
### Pre-project Planning

> For project 3 I decided I wanted to make a blackjack style python game in the command line. 

Once I decided on this concept I started to work out my flow and used Lucid Chart to create an easy to follow process. I wanted to create this early on so I can understand the logic needed to complete the project and in what order I should approach it from. 

> Please see the below flow chart to better understand the initial design and concept

### Pre-Planning Structure

### Structure

#### Deck structure
- Suits

- Card numbers

- Face Cards

- Values for cards

For loop over suits and cards to generate deck of 52 cards.

#### Player Structure

- Name

- Player Cards

- Player Card Value

- Player Score

** If player hits and requests additional card then score, cards and value need to be updated**

#### Dealer Structure

- Dealer Cards

- Dealer Hidden Card

- Dealer Logic

** If dealer has 16 on reveal of hidden card, dealer must hit until they exceed 16**

#### Blackjack Function

- Check if user has blackjack

- Check if dealer has blackjack on reveal of hidden card

#### Compartitive structure

- If either player or dealer exceeds 21 then they bust and the other wins

- Who ever has a higher score while remaining at 21 or lower wins
